## Lesson: Introduction to Calculus

In our recent math class, we learned about the fundamental theorem of calculus, focusing on derivatives and integrals. Here is a summary of the key concepts:

### Derivatives
A derivative represents the rate at which a function is changing at any given point. The derivative of a function \(f(x)\) is denoted as \(f'(x)\) or \(\frac{df}{dx}\).

For example, the derivative of \(f(x) = x^2\) is:
$$f'(x) = 2x$$

### Integrals
An integral represents the accumulation of quantities and can be thought of as the area under a curve. The integral of a function $ f(x) $ is denoted as $ \int f(x) \, dx $.

For example, the integral of $ f(x) = x^2 $ is:
$$\[ \int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C \]$$
